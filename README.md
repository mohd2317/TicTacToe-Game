# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

A **Java console-based Tic Tac Toe game** built using **OOP concepts** — supports replay, player turn choice (X/O), and automatic win/draw detection.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This is a Java console-based **Tic Tac Toe** game built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.  
It’s a simple yet well-structured project, ideal for learning **control flow**, **arrays**, and **user input handling** in Java.

### It supports:
- 👥 Two players (X and O)  
- 🎯 Choice of who plays first  
- 🏁 Automatic win and draw detection  
- 🔁 Option to restart the game after each round  

---

## ✨ Features

✅ Choose whether **X or O** starts first  
✅ Displays the **board after every move**  
✅ Detects **win**, **draw**, and **invalid inputs**  
✅ Allows players to **restart** after a match  
✅ Clean, readable code written with **OOP principles**

## 🧩 Technologies Used

| Category | Details |
|-----------|----------|
| **Language** | Java 8+ |
| **IDE (optional)** | IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VS Code |
| **Concepts Used** | Arrays, Loops, Conditionals, Methods, Exception Handling, Streams |

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The game starts by asking **who should play first (X or O)**.  
2. Players take turns entering a number **(1–9)** corresponding to a board position.  
3. The program **validates** each move and **updates** the board.  
4. After each move:
   - Checks for a **winner or draw**
   - If no one has won, **switches turns automatically**
5. When the match ends, players can **choose to restart or exit**.

## 🖥️ Sample Output
Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe Game!
Who should play first? (X/O): X
X will play first.

|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
|-----------|
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
|-----------|
| 7 | 8 | 9 |
|---|---|---|

X's turn. Enter a slot number (1-9): 5

|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
|-----------|
| 4 | X | 6 |

| 7 | 8 | 9 |
|---|---|---|

## 📚 Learning Highlights

This project demonstrates:

- 💡 How to build an **interactive console application**  
- 🛠 How to apply **methods, loops, and conditions** efficiently  
- ⚡ Practical use of **exception handling** and **input validation**  
- 🔁 Building **replayable logic** with loops and flags
